# Kernel-ISA numeric identity gate (iron law 2, end to end).
#
# Iron law 2 says every operator's twins are bit-identical. Nothing
# checked it at the whole-engine level. kernel_matrix_gate asserts
# COVERAGE - which cells have a hand-written kernel and which are
# honestly empty - and fixed_tier_xcompiler_gate asserts gcc vs Watcom
# on the DEFAULT tier. Neither compares one ISA tier against another in
# the same binary, which is where a twin that drifted would show.
#
# That gap mattered before this gate and matters more now: the operators
# landed in the int-pipeline work (integer SwiGLU, the integer sigmoid
# and exp entries, the integer requantize) all justify themselves partly
# with "integer arithmetic is identical across ISAs by construction".
# By construction is an argument. This is the measurement.
#
# ASSERTS: --kernel mmx and --kernel sse2 produce byte-identical
# --dump-all-logits on both fixtures. One binary, one model, two tiers;
# any difference is a twin that diverged.
#
# NOT asserted: --kernel ref. The scalar reference is not a twin of the
# SIMD tiers - matmul_scalar_ref takes a different path that skips the
# dequant epilogue entirely, so it differs by construction (measured:
# 58,153,879 of 78,905,344 bytes). Asserting it would be asserting
# something false, and a gate that has to be excused is worse than one
# that says what it covers. Its correctness is kernel_matrix_gate's and
# the per-operator exhaustive probes' subject.
#
# Runs on whatever kernels the host offers: if the CPU has no SSE2 the
# tier selector refuses and the gate SKIPs rather than comparing a tier
# against itself, which would pass while measuring nothing.
#
# Exit codes: 0 PASS, 1 FAIL, 2 ERROR/SKIP.

# FLAG SETS, not just fixtures. Default flags do not reach every kernel
# in the matrix: the float Hadamard (fwhtf, lz_fwht) only runs when
# --kv-rot is on, so with one flag set this gate never executed that
# operator once. A gate has to sample where the kernel lives, not merely
# where the model does.
#
# WHAT THE `rot` SET DOES NOT CATCH, measured rather than assumed: with
# lz_fwht's SSE body mutated (second half's pointer +1) this gate still
# reports all four combinations identical. It has to - fwhtf fills its
# sseI/sse2I cells from ONE body, so mmx and sse2 run the same
# instructions and comparing them is blind to that body by construction.
# What proves fwhtf is .prof/fwht_f32_xcheck.sh, which compares the
# kernel against the C in one binary; the same mutation moves it.
#
# The set is here for the kernels --kv-rot SWITCHES rather than the one
# it enables: s->kv_rot_v != 0 takes the paired wsum kernel out of the
# attention epilogue and folds kv_rot_k into the softmax scale, so a
# different selection of twins runs under it than under the default.
#
# One LABEL:FLAGS per LINE, and read with `while read`, not `for` -
# FLAGS contains spaces, and word-splitting a space-separated list turned
# "--kv-rot on" into a flagset named "on" that the loader then tried to
# open as a model directory. It failed loudly here; it would not have
# in a gate whose runs are allowed to be empty.
#
# Adding a flag set here is the cheap half of covering a new operator end
# to end; the expensive half (SIMD arm against the same binary's C arm,
# byte for byte) is the per-operator .prof/*_xcheck.sh probe.
